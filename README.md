In an era where AI agents are expected to operate autonomously and tackle complex tasks, AI Agents in Practice is your roadmap to building these next-generation systems. This book helps you go beyond simple chatbots and create AI agents that plan, reason, collaborate, and solve real-world problems using large language models and the latest open-source frameworks. You'll get a comparative tour of leading AI agent frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph, covering each tool's strengths, ideal use cases, and how to apply them in real projects. Through step-by-step examples, learn to construct single-agent and multi-agent architectures using proven design patterns to orchestrate AI agents working together. Case studies across industries show AI agents driving value in real scenarios, while guidance on responsible AI helps you implement ethical guardrails from day one. AI Agents in Practice also sets the stage with a brief history of AI agents; from early rule-based systems to today's LLM-driven autonomous agents—so you understand how we got here and where the field is headed. By the end, you'll have the practical skills, design insights, and ethical foresight to build and deploy AI agents that truly make an impact.

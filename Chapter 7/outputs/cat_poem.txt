Softly they tread, on paws of stealth, Mysterious beings of untold wealth. Their eyes like moons, a piercing gaze, Whiskers dancing, they weave a maze.

From sunlit perch to shadowy nook, They read the world like an open book. A purr, a leap, a sudden flight, Guardians of dreams in the velvet night.

Oh, noble cats, elusive, free, Keepers of enigmaâ€™s key. In your grace, a world concealed, A quiet strength, forever revealed.
